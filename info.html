                My name is Michael Hinojosa and I currently work at California State University, Monterey Bay as the Technology Specialist for
                    the School of Education. This site is meant to display the projects I work on in both my professional capacity as well as those projects done in my free time. I am patiently awaiting the arrival of my Meta 2 headset to do some work in both augmented reality and mixed reality, I am particularly interested in integrating AR and MR and the web thinking about what a MR or AR website might look like.
